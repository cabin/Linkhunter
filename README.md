Linkhunter
==========

A [Google Chrome][] extension helping you quickly search your [Delicious][] or
[Pinboard][] bookmarks. See the [issues][] page for known bugs and
planned enhancements.


Acknowledgements
----------------

Linkhunter was inspired by the [Moofmarks][] Safari extension, which I sorely
missed after switching back to Chrome. Linkhunter uses the following
technology:

* [CoffeeScript][]
* [Backbone.js][]
* [Underscore.js][]
* [Moment.js][]
* [jQuery][]
* [LESS][]
